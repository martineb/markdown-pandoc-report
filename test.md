Take an observer in a frame of reference moving at a speed $v$ close to that of light $c$ and measuring an interval $\Delta t$ for the time between two events. Now consider a second observer at rest relative to the first and measuring a time $\Delta t'$ between the same events. The relationship between those two time intervals is [@einstein1905electrodynamics]:

$$
\Delta t'=\gamma \Delta t=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\Delta t
$$
